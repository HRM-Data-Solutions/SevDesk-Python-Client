# SevDesk OpenAPI Specification
The OpenAPI documents are based on the official SevDesk specifications. SevDesk provides a file for each group of functionality (e.g. Contacts, Invoices etc.) - however, this introduces a lot of redundant information and causes a lot of additional work when generating code. Hence, the specifications in the package are restructuring the OpenAPI specifications to not only make work with the API easier, but also to reuse as much code as possible. Also, several issues in the original documents have been fixed, deprecated endpoints are removed.
